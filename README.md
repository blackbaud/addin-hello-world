# addin-hello-world
This is a very basic implementation of a SKY Add-in using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This add-in includes a simple "Hello World" tile that demonstrates various capabilities of the SKY Add-in framework.  It also provides a few examples of launching modal dialogs.

This code is running live at https://blackbaudaddinhelloworld.azurewebsites.net (specifically, the tile is running at `/helloworld.html` and the simple modal is running at `/helloworldmodal.html`.

This example references a modal implementated using SKY UX - the source code for the modal is located at https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-spa-addin-modal-demo.

Finally, a SKY UX version of this sample add-in can be found at https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-spa-addin-hello-world.
